# Langton’s Ants (vants)
OK,  it’s time to bring a bunch of different elements together to realize our our next simulation, Langton’s Ants (aka virtual ants aka vants). Let’s take a moment to watch this excellent video that both explains the underlying algorithm and features a great score write by Steina and Woody Vasulka, who, when they weren’t composing, were also pioneers of experimental video art. It might be the only SIGGRAPH video you ever see with a custom score written by famous folks:

In the video Langton implements two different types of vants, but in the seagulls example there's only one, leaving you room to experiment with implementing the other for this assignment. 

## Algorithm Overview
First of all, I’ll point out it is actually possible to run a fragment-shader-only version of Langton’s Ants, where every pixel is a vant:

While (really really really) cool as a technical demo, the above example is perhaps limited in some ways… although definitely not in terms of vant population! But what if we only wanted a few vants? In order to realize a more flexible approach, we’ll combine vertex shaders (where every vertex will represent a vant moved around via transform feedback) with fragment shaders (the fragment shaders will keep track of the “pheromones” ants leave aka trails). 

The core algorithm of our vant:

1. “Sniff” its current location to detect the presence of pheromones
2. *Pheremones found*: Turn 90 degrees counter clockwise, and remove pheromones.
3. *Pheremones not found*: Turn 90 degrees clockwise and leave pheromones.

That’s it. To do this technically we’ll need:

1. “Sniff”: sample a texture which will hold our pheromones traiil
2. *Pheremones found* and *Pheromones not found*: adjust the heading of our vant… since we’re only turning 90 degrees at a time there are only four possible headings, which will prove useful for representation. Update the texture holding the pheromone trail

## Assignment requirements
Take a look at the [Vants example for seagulls](https://charlieroberts.github.io/seagulls/demos/15_vants/). For this mini-assignment, implement at least three different behaviors
for different ant types (the original behavior the seagulls example includes can count as one of these). Experiment and find interesting patterns that come out. Post a link to the 
assignemnt along with two paragraphs (350-400 words) describing the behaviors you created to your course website.
