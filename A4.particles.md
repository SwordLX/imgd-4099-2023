# Assignment 4 - Particles
 
## Requirements
- Decide on a particle effect of your choice to emulate / approximate. This could be something class (laser beam, explosion) or could be something more experimental
(shards of live video flying across the screen).
- Implement your chosen particle effect in a piece that runs in a HTML page hosted at site of your choosing (GitHub Pages or Glitch is fine for this).

- Write one paragraph (~200 words) that describe what you created (which effect you created, what inspired you, what controls you made, any interesting aesthetic decisions).

- Create a repo with all code for the project.

- No video documentation is required for this assignemnt. Update your personal site for the class with a link to the running project, a link to your technical / aesthetic explanation (this could be in the REaDME for your project repo), and a link to your repo.

To be clear, if you're personal website is a simple github repo, after this your primary README should look something like the following:

- Assignment #1: [video](http://wpi.edu), [code](http://wpi.edu), [explanation](http://wpi.edu)
- Assignment #2: [project](http://wpi.edu), [repo](http://wpi.edu), [explanation](http://wpi.edu)
- Assignment #3: [project](http://wpi.edu), [repo](http://wpi.edu), [explanation](http://wpi.edu)
- Assignment #4: [project](http://wpi.edu), [repo](http://wpi.edu), [explanation](http://wpi.edu)
- 
... but with correct links. 

Grading Rubric
---
- 10% Project/repository/explanation is posted to your personal course website correctly
- 50% Particle effect is implemented
- 10% Interaction controls are provided
- 20% Two summary paragraphs. One should concisely explain what you did technically (What option did you explore? What controls did you make?) and a 
final paragraph describing feedback received and how it met or didn't meet your expectations
- 10% free points!

This assignment will count for 10â€“12.5% of your final grade, depending on whether we do four or five assignments in the course. Please take time to ensure that spelling / grammar are correct and that the assignment is linked / posted / hostted correctly so that you don't lose any easy points.
